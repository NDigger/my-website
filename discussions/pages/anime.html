        <h1>someone said anime?</h1>
        <p>I was never seriously interested in it or watched a lot of anime content. It was more about looking at something what managed to actually get me interested in it.</p>
        <p>Total I have watched 4 anime titles, 3 of which were recommended by my friends and one more was found in youtube shorts when I've watched them. I will discuss about them below. Don't take ratings too close because I'm definitely not an expert to judge what's generic and what's not</p>

        <h3><span class="rating">5</span> Made In Abyss</h3>

            <p>I liked main characters and how cruel anime can be sometimes. Killing entire underworld city or killing kids is considered to be ok here. A good horror movie for the evening, it's just a pity it's not finished. <span class="show-hover">And probably it won't be finished anytime soon</span></p>
            <p>I remember lots of moments from it even now. I'm not an active fan but I would like to see the continued story. Even if one season will be devote to the entire floor (or part)</p>

            <p>I'm surprised that it's that high. This is very dumb anime with no plot what makes me love it. I completely forgot everything what has happened during 12 series but if I get desire someday I'll rewatch it. Don't watch it if you're unaware of 18+</p>

            <p>Well, it's the first anime I have ever watched. I found it on youtube shorts and got a desire to watch it myself.</p>
            <p>This anime is about gender change and common life for 12 series (beach episode included). I'm not sure about my opinion nowadays but before I thought that it's the best anime I could have ever watched.</p>
            <p>Not recommended if you anime professional.</p>

            <p>Never thought that when school days go on people kill each other for a bastard and then package his corpse in the bag and go on romantic cruise.</p>
            <p>I said all.</p>
