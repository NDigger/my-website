        <h1>much</h1>
        <p>I began drawing when I was 15 out of boredom.</p>
        <p>For 2 years I was drawing on my mobile with 5.46" screen without any desire to learn something so impovements were quite unnoticable</p>
        <p>Even after 2 years I didn't have desire to learn anatomy so I decided to try keep it simple but proper. For now I don't succeed in it.</p>
        <p>I never drawn human because human are boring everywhere.</p>
        <p>I used to draw in real life on classes when I was bored but quickly I switched to digital apps. I used Набросок when I only began and now I use Ibis Paint X.</p>
        <h2>Currently</h2>
        <p>I enter when my brain is melting or I have nothing to do and I don't want to watch YouTube.</p>
