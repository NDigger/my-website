        <h1>Well well well...</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I play games for a long while. I really love games and I played tons of them.</p>
        <p>I began playing games approximately on 9 years. Since I didn't have my own laptop or PC I used mobile to play them.</p>
        <p>Quickly I got my laptop and I began playing all my free time for several years, up to 17 years. Most of games i've played were focused on competition or just communication with people. After 14.12.2024 I completely abandoned all online games I've played and was dependent from. Currently I rarely play offline games and may not touch games for weeks or even months.</p>
        <p>It doesn't mean that I will never enter any online game again but I definitely lost interest in any of them.</p>
        <h2>Important to note!</h2>
        <p>I haven't focused on common online games like CS, Dota or other games.</p>
        <p>Usually I see that people play these games since they were young what might be one of reasons why they stick to them.</p>
        <p>I tried to play</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Dota</li>
            <li>CS:GO / CS2</li>
            <li>Warface</li>
            <li>Team Fortress 2</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But I've enjoyed only Warface when I was 13 for several months. After a while both my accounts got stolen and I left it.</p>
        <h2>What have I played overall?</h2>
        <h3>Brawl Stars</h3>
        <div class="clearfix">
            <div class="additional-picture">
                <img class="additional-picture" src="pictures/brawlStars.jpg" alt="brawl stars account">
                <img class="additional-picture" src="pictures/brawlStarsAlt.jpg" alt="brawl stars alt account">
            </div>
            <p>The first game which comes to my head is <strong>Brawl Stars</strong>. I've stuck to this game for entire 5 years.</p>
            <p>I wouldn't have played it if not my friend from 2019 who has invited me to this game just to play it for a while. I was actually dependent on this game for 4 years and I revisited this game every day just to get daily gifts and <strong>kill</strong> my time. I loved to do that a lot before.</p>
            <p>On the last year I was that one teammate who doesn't care about any recources that supposed to be valuable so I was just playing for fun and ruining games for other. I was that one teammate who you would never want to see when you're playing game seriously.</p>
            <p>As a <a href="https://brawltime.ninja/ru/profile/CJYC2JP#time" target="_blank">website</a> says this game stole my 2210 hours of life. Probably it's almost one of the most influencing games I've ever played in my life.</p>
        </div>
        <h3>Angry Birds Series</h3>
        <p>I played Angry Birds games for a very long pediod of time. I would still play them if they would be working as before.</p>
        <p>A lot of my favourite games are dead. And ones that left don't even work on my phone because of content overdose. Battlepasses, gifts, sales, and 10 more buttons were added in each game.</p>
        <h3>Open Hexagon</h3>
        <p>A game based on Super Hexagon that I've played before too.</p>
        <p>I discovered this game to myself when I was around 12. I haven't played it much back then.</p>
        <p>I began playing more actively when I turned 16 and remembered about it by accident.</p>
        <p>I didn't have plans to buy it because I prefer not to buy games and spend money on them. For some reason I decided to type a joke message in a discord channel where I asked anyone who can to buy me the game and someone actually decided to it. The game price is 4$ what's not too cheap considering that the person who bought it didn't know who I am and why do I ask for it. We still chat sometimes and I got access to even more games <span class="show-hover">(even though I don't play games as much as before)</span> thanks to him and his friend.</p>
        <p>After I got the game I played it for around 1.5 years and posted some scores on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@scout1495" target="_blank">channel</a>. Also I made 4 packs for this game.</p>
        <p>My biggest achievement in the game is getting my Delta pack rated. Thanks to Vipre and everyone else.</p>
        <p>This was also pretty fun game where I met some amazing people. I'm really happy that I've played it and took a participation in game competitions.</p>
        <p>Prism pack is perfect. Other opitions aren't taken.</p>
        <h3>Geometry Dash</h3>
        <p>I played this game for around half a year since 2.2 was released and I got a lot of fun and rated levels during this period. After that time levels became way better so I didn't want to stay long because it felt as a pressure. It surprises me that people can devote that much time to a single level or their part. Time is not only measured in days. Sometimes it can be <strong>weeks</strong>, or even <strong>months</strong>...</p>
        <p>Even I devoted to one of my levels an entire month. It's a Beatpulse level. Even though it took me that much I don't regret about it because I still love seeing people completing and complaining about it.</p>
        <p>You can see this level below if you want. I like music that I chose and I love how different it is.</p>
        <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Iw1hjf4jSq8" frameborder="0"></iframe>
        <p>The main fun from Geometry Dash was brought to me with it's mappacks. I had a lot of fun while trying to complete this simple and old levels. I find them more interesting than huge quality levels that being made now. Tastes differ I guess.</p>
        <p>I'm still revisiting this game sometimes, even though my sessions are not longer than 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>This huge but clean RobTop project motivated me to try out myself in game dev.</p>
        <h2>Offline games</h2>
        <p>I haven't played much of online games because I had focus only on some for a very long time but I have played a bit more offline games.</p>
        <p>I don't plan on mumbling and commenting every game I've played. Only some that I want to highlight. <span class="show-hover">+ my reviews on some games I found on discord.</span></p>
        <p>Also. Don't take me wrong but <strong>I love obtaining achievements</strong> sometimes even more than completing games themself. It's just relaxing to recomplete the game with additional conditions. I can't explain that. It concerned at least all Valve games and other.</p>
        <h3>Half-life 2 All Parts, Portal, Portal 2</h3>
        <p>I first played them on 2023. I would have not played them if I wasn't shown that orange box is on sale in Steam.</p>
        <div class="clearfix">
            <h4><span class="rating">4.8</span> Portal</h4>
            <img src="pictures/portal.jpg" alt="portal" class="additional-picture">
            <p>Portal is definitely one of the best games out of these. I loved it, I still love it and I will be loving it. Main plot was pretty simple and insteresting to play (was a bit annoying after 19 rooms were over but anyway). Additional challenges and achievements were also amazing. I loved speedrunning maps and completing their more complex versions. I wish I could play this game again without knowing about it.</p>
        </div>
        <h4><span class="rating">4.5</span> Half-life 2</h4>
        <p>When I played Half-life 2 every Spider Crab that was jumping on me was managing to scare me. That has ruined my enjoyment from Half life 2. Only when I've completed all Half Life 2 games I was pity that they were over because I loved Half Life after a while and even loved these Crabs that always jumped on my head.</p>
        <h4><span class="rating">4.5</span> Portal 2</h4>
        <p>Portal 2 is... Well... it's also good. A lot of people when looking at Portal and Portal 2 would definitely prefer a newer version because it has better graphics, better voice and all this but graphics and atmosphere of first version was way more interesting to me. Plus I loved that I can actually see my progress and everything is divided by 19 rooms and some plot later. In Portal 2 it's a full game which doesn't feel room based. It's more open and even when rooms appear, they do appear only for a while just to imitate it. I'm very bad critic hi.</p>
        <h3><span class="rating">4.5</span> Black Mesa</h4>
        <p>I would also like to include Black Mesa which is not official valve product. It's a rework of Half Life which I also enjoyed. It feels good and bringing the hat from beginning to the end of the game was also fun somehow.</p>
        <h3><span class="rating">4.5</span> Infinitode 2</h3>
        <p>And one more game I want to mention is infinitode 2. I have more than 200 hours in it. It's a Tower Defence with plot which can be completed in 10-20 hours where you can progress more and more if you get desire. The thing which really made me interested in this game is developer console if you complete the game far enough (it allows you to do anything what you want). And if you grind for 100 more hours you will get 1000x times more resources what's insane. This game would not get that big rating from other people probably but I really love design, chiptune music and surprisingly interested grinding.</p>
        <p>But I would not play it nowadays.</p>

        <h2>Reviews</h2>
        <p>Here you can also see some reviews I wrote in discord earlier. Ratings were set right after the game was completed. Text wasn't edited in any way. <span class="show-hover">I'm surprised how much text I can write when I don't overthink about it.</span></p>

            <h3><span class="rating">4.5</span> LonaRPG</h3>
            <img src="https://static.tildacdn.com/tild3638-3863-4936-b438-663861626635/UROHOJDo5S8.jpg" alt="lona rpg" class="additional-picture">
            <p>i wasnt sure do I want to share about this game but it's amazing, after some suffering in the beginning I found ways to survive and even earn money without big loses. Sadly full completion is very annoying for now because even if you complete all the quests on the map you won't be able to complete the game due to price increments during time. Overall I can compare enjoyment to the old good VOTV game, since it I haven't played something that enjoyable, of course i played paper lily too but it's not as memorisable so I could mention it anywhere. On youtube reviews lonarpg may look as the game you could expect me to play but in fact people on youtube highlight only what they want, in this game I felt unusual because of characters which all feel shit. For example I could save some people from death, help them for a long while and they can just make me slave if they need or want, and I didn't see lots of exceptions. Almost each character I communicate with works with me only if they have benefits from it, how cruel. Closer to the end of demo version I find some nice characters which don't look like they want to make me slave or eat me (the game also includes cannibalism at some point), but of course plot it being cut off when I meet them :(. Overall there was a lot of fun stuff to discover and a lot of nauseous content which is definitely not for everyone. Main quests are perfect and well balanced. save load hardcore game, it says I spent 12 hours on it but I'm sure that number is higher than 30 hours because I wasted a lot of time to reload the same quests and trying to complete them over and over.  I give it strong 4.5 out of 5, not perfect to me, it becomes a bit repeatable and routine closer to the end and side quests don't seem to be unique when you complete more of them. also this is amazing wall of text I made without google translator, sorta repeatable but im still proud</p>

            <p>Моя конечная оценка: 4.5/5, я был уверен что эта игра меня вообще не удивит после лоны РПГ но все таки она смогла, здесь даже сюжет не особо нужен чтобы было забавно играть. -.5 балла за мое личное унижение за то что я нашел секретки но не имел способности добраться к ним ведь нет навыков и за проблемы с фонами которые достаточно сильные. Ещё система состояний игрока работает фифти фифти оч поломанная, и иногда тайлы были недоложены но это видно. Мелкие претензии но я их запомнил и упомянул, а в общем было очень даже забавно и интересно :D</p>

            <p>да</p>
            <p>Здесь тонна фетишей и тонна всего</p>
            <p>Я 30 часов играл мне понравилось</p>
            <p>Итоговая оценка скорее всего 3.5/5 я играл ради сюжета а сюжет здесь это какой-то пиздец хоть мне он и понравился</p>

        <h2>Currently</h2>
        <p>I don't play games as much as before, during 5 months I haven't spent more than 60 hours on playing games. It may still sound a lot but I think someone grinds <strong>500+</strong> hours during this time.</p>

        <h1>hmm...</h1>
        <p>I began making games because I could see how other games work and expected that making games will be quite an easy task which doesn't require much skill. I was wrong and right at once.</p>
        <p>To make games I only tried to use <strong>Unity</strong> and <strong>Godot</strong>. I chose Godot because I didn't know how does C# work and I just wanted everything to be as simple as possible.</p>
        <p>Making games is not only about programming. You also need reasonable music, textures, and time to combine all this and make it look good. Scripts are more about to program everything you need, create scenes where you can put all the content. Then it's just about "Coding" simple mechanics like "crafting various items" or "what will happen if you talk with specifically this character".</p>
        <p>I don't have much experience for now in here. And I'm not sure I will obtain more of it in future, because I'm not good at drawing to create a lot of textures which will fit each other and create the entire working game.</p> 
        <p>Anyway I created few playable projects so I tried myself in it.</p>
        <p>If I would've rated my own games then my ratings would be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="rating">2.5</span> I wanna be the NDagger</li>
            <li><span class="rating">2</span> Snipe</li>
            <li><span class="rating">0.5</span> Nameless Place</li>
