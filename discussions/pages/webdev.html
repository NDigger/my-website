        <h1>It's very random</h1>
        <h2>How have I come to it?</h2>
        <p>Accidentally. When I realised that I don't get any emotions when playing games anymore I went wild and after a while I was recommended some sites to learn it and github.</p>
        <p>And it's still what I'm doing even now. For now I do this for 5 months total. You don't see other projects because I haven't posted them and I don't have plans on doing it.</p>
        <p>I learn webdev using Google Chrome, freeCodeCamp and codewars to practice js.</p>
        <h3>Frontend</h3>
        <p>Currently I didn't have much practice with frontend libraries that supposed to simplify page support.</p>
        <p>I had practice only with following libraries:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>React</li>
            <li>SASS</li>
            <li>jQuery</li>
            <li>Redux</li>
        </ul>
        <p>None of these are used in this page due to their size. Github probably would accept sites with high file size but I still prefer to keep pages size small.</p>
        <p>Plus using React for bigger projects seems to be quite confusing. I had practice only with 1 page sites.</p>
        <h3>Backend</h3>
        <p>No practice for now.</p>
        <hr>
        <p>Below you can see screenshots of some websites I made during 4 months.</p>
